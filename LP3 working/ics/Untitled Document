Key Generation

Random 10 bits
P10 permute
Divide into 2 halves
Left round shift by 1 - outLeft1
Combine and put into P8 permute
Get Key1
Use outLeft1 and shift left by 2 bits
Combine and put into P8 permute
Get Key2
 

Plain to Cipher

8 bit random
Put into IP8 table to permute
Break into 2 halves - 
Take right half and put into EP expansion table
XOR Key1 with output of expansion
Get the output
Split o/p into 2 halves
Put left half into S0
Put right half into S1
Combine o/p of S0 & S1
Put into P4 permute
XOR with left half of IP8 table o/p
Use o/p as right half of next round
Use right half of IP8 table o/p as left half of next round

Repeat all steps but use Key2
